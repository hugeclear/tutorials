about:
    description: 'The greenlet package is a spin-off of Stackless, a version of CPython
        that

        supports micro-threads called "tasklets". Tasklets run pseudo-concurrently

        (typically in a single or a few OS-level threads) and are synchronized with

        data exchanges on "channels".


        A "greenlet", on the other hand, is a still more primitive notion of

        micro-thread with no implicit scheduling; coroutines, in other words. This

        is useful when you want to control exactly when your code runs. You can

        build custom scheduled micro-threads on top of greenlet; however, it seems

        that greenlets are useful on their own as a way to make advanced control

        flow structures. For example, we can recreate generators; the difference

        with Python''s own generators is that our generators can call nested

        functions and the nested functions can yield values too. Additionally,

        you don''t need a "yield" keyword. See the example in

        tests/test_generator.py.


        Greenlets are provided as a C extension module for the regular unmodified

        interpreter.


        Greenlets are lightweight coroutines for in-process concurrent programming.
